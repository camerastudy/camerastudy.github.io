# Study Summary
Principle Investigator: Dr. Jennifer Rabin
Full Study Title: Investigating risk and protective factors for dementia in a multi-ethnic cohort
Target Age Group: 55-85
Target Population: Healthy volunteers
Location of Study: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Bayview Campus, Toronto, ON
<br/>
# Study Description
The aim of the CAMERA study is to better understand whether certain lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, are 
related to early changes in memory and thinking abilities in older adults. We are especially interested in enrolling 
individuals who identify as being of East Asian or South Asian descent, because there is a lack of research on brain 
health on these individuals in Canada. 
<br/>
# Participant's Role
As part of the study, participants are asked to come to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre 1-2 times per year for 5 years. 
During the study visits, participants will complete:
<ul>
<li>tasks assessing your memory and thinking
<li>questionnaires about your background and health
<li>a fasting blood draw
<li>a brain MRI scan
<li>a vital signs assessment (blood pressure, height, weight)
<li>a short walking and balance assessment
</ul>
Each visit will last 4-5 hours. In between visits, you may be asked to wear a wrist watch-like device which tracks your
physical movement for up to 2 weeks.
