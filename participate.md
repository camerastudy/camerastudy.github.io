## How To Participate
Thank you for your interest in participating in CAMERA! The first step is to learn about the study to get a sense of 
why the study is being run and what you can expect as a participant. Please head over to the [About](/about.md) page to
learn more, if you haven't already.
<br/><br/>
If you would like to participate in CAMERA and feel that you qualify for the study, the next step is to get in touch
with us by email. You can use the contact form below or email us directly at <a href="mailto:cbhlab@sunnybrook.ca">cbhlab@sunnybrook.ca</a>.
We will be in touch as soon as possible to set up a time to speak over the phone with you about your eligibility. This
phone call will be approximately 20 minutes during which we will ask you some questions about your background to determine 
if you are eligible to participate. 
<br/><br/>
After the phone call, the study team will review your answers to determine if you meet the eligibility criteria. We will
let you know as soon as possible, and if you do, we will schedule your first and second study visits for your first year
of participation.
