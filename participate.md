## How To Participate
Thank you for your interest in participating in CAMERA! If you haven't done so already, please head over to the 
[about](/about.md) page to learn more about CAMERA.
<br/><br/>
If you would like to participate in CAMERA and feel that you qualify for the study, the next step is to get in touch
with us by email. You can use the contact form below or email us directly at <a href="mailto:cbhlab@sunnybrook.ca">cbhlab@sunnybrook.ca</a>.
We will be in touch as soon as possible to set up a time to speak over the phone with you about your eligibility. During 
this roughly 20 minute phone call, we will ask you some questions about your background to determine if you are eligible 
to participate.

After the phone call, the study team will review your answers to determine if you meet the eligibility criteria. We will
let you know as soon as possible.
