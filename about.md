## Summary
Principle Investigator: Dr. Jennifer Rabin<br/>
Target Age Group: 55-85<br/>
Target Population: Healthy volunteers<br/>
Location: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Bayview Campus, Toronto, ON
<br/>
## Description
The aim of the CAMERA study is to better understand whether certain genetic and lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, 
high blood pressure, hearing ability) are related to early changes in memory, brain function, and blood markers in older adults. 
We are particularly interested in enrolling adults who identify as being of East Asian or South Asian descent since little
research has focused on risk and protective factors for dementia in these groups. If certain lifestyle factors are found 
to be protective against detrimental changes in memory, brain function, and blood markers, it may lead to improved 
prevention/intervention strategies for dementia in Canadaâ€™s diverse communities.

## Participant Requirements
As part of the study, participants are asked to come to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre <strong>1-2 times per year for 5 years</strong>. 
During the study visits, participants will complete:
<ul class="" style="margin-left:15px">
  <li>tasks assessing your memory and thinking</li>
  <li>questionnaires about your background and health</li>
  <li>a fasting blood draw</li>
  <li>a brain MRI scan</li>
  <li>a vital signs assessment (blood pressure, height, weight)</li>
  <li>a short walking and balance assessment</li>
</ul>
Each visit will last 4-5 hours. In between visits, you will be asked to wear a wrist watch-like device, which tracks your
physical activity, for up to 2 weeks.
