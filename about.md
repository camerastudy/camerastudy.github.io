## Summary
Target Population: East Asian, South Asian, White Participants<br/>
Target Age Group: 55–85<br/>
Location: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Bayview Campus, Toronto, ON
Duration of Enrolment: 5 Years
<br/>
## Description
The aim of the CAMERA study is to better understand whether certain health and lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, 
high blood pressure, hearing ability) are related to early changes in memory and brain function in older adults. If certain 
lifestyle factors are found to be protective against detrimental changes in memory and brain function, it may lead to 
improved prevention/intervention strategies for dementia in Canada’s diverse communities. 
<br/>
## Eligibility
We are enrolling adults, aged 55–85, who are relatively healthly and identify as East Asian, South Asian, or White. To be
eligible, you must not have a formal diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease. If you are
unsure of whether you qualify, please reach out to us; we can provide you with more information about the eligibility
criteria for CAMERA.

## Study Requirements
